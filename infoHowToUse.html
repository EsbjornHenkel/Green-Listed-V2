To get started, you can try the following two demo alternatives:

**Using the included GeCKOv2 Reference Library:**

1. Choose a GeCKOv2 library, for example, the human A+B library.
2. Copy the content of the `demo_input_example.txt` file (found here) and paste it into the input box. Alternatively, input a number of genes of your interest. Make sure to press enter between each gene.
3. Press the run button.

**Using another Reference Library:**

1. Download the sample Reference Library `demo_source_list.txt` here.
2. Upload the `demo_source_list.txt` file under "Upload a Reference Library".
3. Set the Gene ID Column to 1 (as the first column of this reference library contains the Gene IDs).
4. Set the gRNA Column to 2 (as the second column of this reference library contains the gRNA sequences).
5. Download an example of a typical input query `demo_input_example.txt` here.
6. Copy the content of the `demo_input_example.txt` file and paste it into the input box.
7. Press the run button.

**Note:** The sample Reference Library (`demo_source_list.txt`) file contains only a few genes and cannot be used to design a functional library as the gRNA sequences and scores are random.
